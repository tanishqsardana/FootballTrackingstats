# FootballTrackingstats
A model to track objects on a football field

Used Yolov5 to track footballers, football, referees and goalkeepers(atleast tried to).

Wrote some annotator functions to get a more analytical look in our output videos with markers and pins for players and football along with the player in control.

This project makes use of clips from the DFL - Bundesliga Data Shootout competition.

Here is how the program outputs.


Try to run the plot_image function again if it doesnt work.
